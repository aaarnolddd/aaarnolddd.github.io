				<h2>What is Lorem-Ipsum?</h2>
				<time datetime="2019-09-05">Sep. 05, 2019</time>

				<p>

					Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

				<h1><a href="#2">Journaling</a></h1>
				<h2>the philosophy behind the hobby</h2>
				<time datetime="2019-09-05">Sep. 05, 2019</time>

				<p>

					Inspired by the <a title="Meditations" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditations">personal writings</a> of the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius, I always thought that journaling my life and thoughts could be an act comparable to meditation; and could be a way that I could release some stress. During the creation of this blog, I was conflicted about what the theme of this project would be, and it is funny that I am deciding to turn this blog into a journal, based on how the aesthetic of the website turned out to be.

				<h2>Let's see if it's worth it</h2>

				<p>

					Journaling daily has been said to ease the symptoms of anxiety. Lately, I have been under some stress because time seems to be flying past quicker than I can keep track of; even my parents mentioned it today. I am at a major changing point in my life and it seems like I have to adapt quickly to avoid long-term suffering. However, reflecting back on this now; I think that maybe I should just take some time to calm down and learn to not take life so seriously.

				<h1><a href="#4">Going forward</a></h1>
				<h2>What does the future hold?</h2>
				<time datetime="2019-09-06T22:40">Sep. 06, 2019</time>

				<p>

					I have always taken some sort of pride in what I do in life. The process of creation, and putting something out into the world has always been something that has given me a tremendous sense of achievement. You can see this in things I have done in the past, such as creating my own .webs.com website, or trying to learn C++ with my highschool frend so that I may create my own video games. This passion still runs deep in my soul. I still want to create something, be it a podcast, another website, a portfolio, or whatever else I can think of. I want to turn these things into a career that I can actually enjoy. I think that what I really need to do is to wait and learn different things and try as many things as I can, so that I can decide what I want to do in my own time, and enjoy the process along then way, living free of anxiety and stress, and my own compulsive nature of wanting to do everything all at once.

				<h1><a href="#5">Tamarind</a></h1>
				<h2>Named after the first thing I saw on my desk</h2>
				<time datetime="2019-09-07">Sep. 07, 2019</time>

				<p>

					The skin on my right foot big toe is dry and cracked, making it hard to even bend my toe without feeling any pain. But that aside, for a guy who always writes about not letting anxiety about the future rule him, I spent all of today thinking even more about the future. It's not long till I finish my Bachelor's Degree and begin looking for a full time job, and this seems like a huge step in my life. No more three-month long vacations, no mid-semester breaks, no relaxing. However, I am looking forward to being able to support myself and my family once I start earning a full time income.

					It seems that as time goes on, the monetary system works even less in favour of the humans who created it. House prices are skyrocketing, while the median wage rises slowly over the years; making it incredibly difficult for some people to have access to even the most basic housing. I am fearful that I will be trapped in this system just as I see many people trapped around me today, a slave to money. Somewhere in my mind, I wish I could live a simpler life, free of these worries, the way nature intended, but I realise that it is money that improved our standard of living exponentially. Where did we go wrong? Nonetheless, I will have to put up with this no matter what my opinion is, unless a better solution comes around.

					I have recently heard about things such as the 'two-day rule' which encourages making a commitment to doing some sort of exercise every second day at the least. I have been neglecting my health for a while now, not leaving my house and choosing to play video-games. I heard about this concept from <a title="Matt D'Avella" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/blackboxfilmcompany">Matt D'Avella</a> who also produced some other videos which I really liked, <a title="Simple Steps to Financial Freedom" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATDYLTnGJV0">Simple Steps to Financial Freedom</a> being my favourite, which has motivated me to start thinking about my money more wisely. I have decided to try and implement these ideas in my life, let's see how this turns out.

				<h1><a href="#6">Hollywood's Bleeding</a></h1>
				<h2>But stay calm</h2>
				<time datetime="2019-09-09">Sep. 09, 2019</time>

				<p>

					It's been a couple of day since I last wrote. I am currently writing this while listening to Post Malone's new album, <a title="Hollywood's Bleeding" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood's_Bleeding">Hollywood's Bleeding.</a> Anyways, Is it possible to control your body using your mind and thoughts? This is something I have somewhat heard of before, things such as epigenetics intrigue me because common genetic griefs can be avoided by a change in lifestyle. Nonetheless, I was just thinking about how cool it would be to be able to control your body using the <em>power of thought.</em> Maybe meditation might be the missing link? Ancient civillizations seem to have had excellent health. Let's see.

				<h1><a href="#7">Obsession</a></h1>
				<h2>My addiction...</h2>
				<time datetime="2019-09-30">Sep. 30, 2019</time>

				<p>
					
					21 days since I last wrote. I am stuck at a cross-road in my life. Some things seem out of my understanding, while others seem clear as light. I have a real problem with addiction, no matter which vice I pick, I just have an extremely addictive personality. I am easily obsessed. 

				</p>
				
				<p>
					
					I realised that I have been living with constant anxiety and distractions. I have failed to live in the present for most of my life, and I don't understand how it happened. I often fail to realise the blessing that is the present moment. I am caught up in anxiety and mind-loops, unable to enjoy my life, and it really drives me crazy. I stick to random thoughts and let them take over my mind, even when it is apparent that it is harming me. I can't continue to live like this, I need to make a change in my life. Although I don't understand how I can do this, I am going to make an active decision to enjoy every moment for what it is in the present. I will eliminate my anxiety.

					I have recently taken a liking for architecture. I feel as if it would have been a more suitable career path for me as opposed to Civil Engineering, and I am afraid that maybe I shouldn't have jumped straight into uni at the end of high-school, simply believing that it was the 'right' thing to do. These are some things I need to work on, but doing some research I found that it is possible for me to pursue my dream without having to go through the tedious process of university again. I do not want to be the old guy in class, and this is another anxiety that has been plagueing me lately, even though I realize it is such a silly thing to worry about. However, it is people such as <a title="Peter Zumthor" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Zumthor">Peter Zumthor</a> and <a title="Tadao Ando" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tadao_Ando">Tadao Ando</a> who became self-taught Architects, who give me hope that maybe I didn't entirely waste my time at university, as it is what got me interested in Architecture in the first place.

					Now let's live our lives in the present moment, and see what happens. If you are reading this, I love you.

					The beauty in music lies not only in the notes themselves, but the intent, and silence.
